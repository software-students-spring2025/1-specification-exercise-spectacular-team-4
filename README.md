## Stakeholders

**Stakeholder:**

Alina is a NYU student who reads often, and currently uses Goodreads to rate books, keep track of books she has read, and find new books to read. However, she feels that Goodreads could be improved in design and function.

#### Goals/Needs:  

- A place to talk with other users casually about a specific book or series 
- Get better and more accurate recommendations for new books to read
- Streamlined interface that focuses on tracking books and sharing opinions
- Platform with more focus on what friends and other users are currently reading

#### Problems/Frustrations:  

- Few places to converse online with others about a book or series, especially if the book/series is not popular
- Design of the Goodreads app is not good, since you have to go through multiple screens to reach your shelves (user’s lists of books) 
- Goodreads search function often brings up books unrelated to search query
- Recommendations usually not accurate to user's preferences, takes a long time to find a good book to read
- No half-star ratings in Goodreads (ex. a 4.5 star rating), only whole-star ratings allowed

## Wireframe Diagrams
Create a set of wireframe diagrams representing every screen of the application. Wireframes are black-and-white diagrams that show the general layout of the screen, and the content that appears on each screen, but not the actual colors, images, fonts, or other visual design elements that will be used in the final product.
